# Fedora Post Install Script

A small shell script for personal use, forked from FHEK789. Thanks mate!
Now that I mainly use Fedora, this'll setup my daily driver/gaming machine the way that works best.

## Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/al12gamer/fedora-postinstall.git
cd fedora-postinstall
chmod +x fedora.sh
./fedora.sh
```

## License
Have a look at the [license file](./LICENSE) for details.
